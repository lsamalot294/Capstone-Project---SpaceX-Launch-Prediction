# ### You will notice that a lot of the data are IDs. For example the rocket column has no information about the rocket just an identification number.
# 
# ### We will now use the API again to get information about the launches using the IDs given for each launch. Specifically we will be using columns rocket, payloads, launchpad, and cores.

# In[15]:


# Lets take a subset of our dataframe keeping only the features we want and the flight number, and date_utc.
data = data[['rocket', 'payloads', 'launchpad', 'cores', 'flight_number', 'date_utc']]

# We will remove rows with multiple cores because those are falcon rockets with 2 extra rocket boosters and rows that have multiple payloads in a single rocket.

data = data[data['payloads'].map(len)==1]

# Since payloads and cores are lists of size 1 we will also extract the single value in the list and replace the feature.
data['cores'] = data['cores'].map(lambda x : x[0])
data['payloads'] = data['payloads'].map(lambda x : x[0])

# We also want to convert the date_utc to a datetime datatype and then extracting the date leaving the time
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date_utc']).dt.date

# Using the date we will restrict the dates of the launches
data = data[data['date'] <= datetime.date(2020, 11, 13)]


# # From the rocket we would like to learn the booster name
# 
# From the payload we would like to learn the mass of the payload and the orbit that it is going to
# 
# From the launchpad we would like to know the name of the launch site being used, the longitude, and the latitude.
# 
# From cores we would like to learn the outcome of the landing, the type of the landing, number of flights with that core, whether gridfins were used, whether the core is reused, whether legs were used, the landing pad used, the block of the core which is a number used to seperate version of cores, the number of times this specific core has been reused, and the serial of the core.
# 
# The data from these requests will be stored in lists and will be used to create a new dataframe.
